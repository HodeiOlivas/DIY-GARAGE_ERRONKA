Ahead of tomorrows presentation, as I told you a week or two ago, the 80%-85% of the whole project it's made by myself.

In order to demostrate the situation, I would like to write another task table apart from the one written on the documentation 
of the group. Its only for you and the rest of the teachers to know the real situation of the group. Because, they only worked 
something today (last day before the presentation). I have to say that, after contrasting our website with the other group's 
ones, I realized that ours is terrible bad; and that means that we are going to be exposed in front of everyones. 

For tomorrow's presentation, I would like to give you the task table that represents the reality of the distribution of work



al contrastar nuestra página web con la de otros compañeros de otros grupos, 
me he dado cuenta de que la nuestra es terriblemente mala, y que vamos a quedar en
 evidencia delante de todos
